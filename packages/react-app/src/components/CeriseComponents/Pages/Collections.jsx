          Cerise is a digital house that sells tokenized music, street wearables and films. Aside from making profit on
          collections over original work and cultural collaboration, Cerise also has drops where 100% of the mint sales
          go to a charity organization with a wallet on a blockchain. These drops express bloodshed around the world
          with regards to human rights issues, animal harm, domestic violence and other causes.
